# Introduction

This template project can be used a the basis for building a course or
alternatively, to create a multi-stop demo of an application or software
module.

It has the following projects defined:

- **project_template**
  This is the 'base' project that aggregates all other projects in the build.
  Customize the name in build.sbt to your needs.

- **common**
  This project contains 'common' code: it will be visible by all other projects.

- **exercise_000_*** and **exercise_001_***
  These are two sample projects (which depend on `common`)
